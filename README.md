## Course Information

### Descreption
It is vital for service providerâ€™s policy leaders, engineers, analysts, and managers to gain an understanding of how big data can be used to positively support the decision-making processes of the services. 
A strong understanding of data science enables engineers to forecast emerging trends, identify potential future behavior, discover patterns, inform policy, making managerial decision, generate individual medical diagnostics and treatment plans, and generate meaning and insight from the vast amount of data that streams in and through the work environments. 
A knowledge and skill base in data sciences is becoming an increasing desirable for individuals working in developing Medical Applications, Medical Diagnostic, Data Processing, and Healthcare Management Systems. 
Essential data science concepts relevant to practical applications are covered in this course and including problem formulation; data acquisition; data pre-processing, modeling, simulation, analysis, and AI. 
Hands on experience with data science tools, techniques and technologies will be discussed. 
Data integration, analysis, and presentation of results; comprehensive applications of data warehousing and mining in areas of BI, data visualization, digital twin and digital medicine will be explained.
